- It is the first phase of any hacking process.
- It involves gathering information about a target to identify vulnerabilities.
- Can be ,
  1. Passive (No direct interaction with the target).
  2. Active ( Direct interaction with the target).

### Types of Recon
1. Passive Recon
   - Eg: DNS queries, social media analysis, google dorking.
   - DNS query: A request sent by the dns client to the dns server to resolve a domain name into its corresponding IP address.
   - google dorking: process of using advance search operations to uncover hidden or sensitive information.

       - Domain registration and ownership information.
     - Shodan
       - Search Engine for IoT devices and Open ports.
2. Active Recon
   - Eg: Network scanning, ping sweeps, banner grabbing.
   - ping sweeps : network scanning technique used to identify which IP address corresponds to live hosts on the network.
   - banner grabbing:
   - Tools:
     - nmap
       - Network mapping, port scanning, service detection.
     - netcat
       - reading and writing data across networks, banner grabbing.
     - Nikto
